# Simple University: Full Stack Web Project

Simple University/Organization,  MVC Full Stack Web Project using:


- **.NET Framework and C#** for server-side code.
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** and **SQL** for the database.
- **Postman** for testing APIs.
- **React.js** for client-side code, incorporating **HTML (JSX in React), CSS, and JavaScript**.
- **Bootstrap** for layout and styling.
- **Node.js** for managing npm packages and facilitating complex, scalable React applications.

The Last updated Branch I used was the **"Feature/apply_page"**, which will be continued whenever I get time later on (ISA).

Feel free to check a **video** of the current version of it until now:
